This is my first time using GitHub but I'm using this to share my code so I can get more familiar with it in the future. Let me know if there any issues with viewing it or if you have any questions.
There aren't any data visualizations yet besides tables. Data visualizations can be created with those tables though (I think). The pretty visualizations can come later I'm pretty sure.
I hope you guys read all the notes that I left in there too because I think they provide context as to why I wrote the code in that way.
